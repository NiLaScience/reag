# ðŸŽ“ ReAG SDK

## Introduction

The ReAG SDK provides a production-grade framework for integrating Reasoning Augmented Generation (ReAG) into your applications. Designed to work with both Python and Typescript, this SDK simplifies document ingestion and intelligent querying without the need for API keys.

By removing the complexities of traditional RAG systems, the SDK enables developers to directly ingest markdown formatted documents complete with metadata and execute contextual queries seamlessly.
