# ðŸŽ“ ReAG SDK

## Introduction

Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on a two-step process: first, semantic search retrieves documents based on surface-level similarities; then, a language model generates answers from those documents. While this method works, it often misses deeper contextual insights and can pull in irrelevant information. ReAG â€“ Reasoning Augmented Generation â€“ offers a robust alternative by feeding raw documents directly to the language model, allowing it to assess and integrate the full context. This unified approach leads to more accurate, nuanced, and context-aware responses.

# How ReAG Works

ReAG transforms document querying with a streamlined process:

- Raw Document Ingestion: Documents are processed in full, without prior chunking or indexing.
- Holistic Evaluation: The language model reads entire texts to determine their relevance and extract key information.
- Dynamic Synthesis: Relevant details are combined into comprehensive answers, mirroring human research methods.

This method eliminates the pitfalls of over-simplified semantic matches and delivers insights that truly address the query's intent.
